This programming assignment's purpose was to create an interactive canvas using only 
html and javascript with some gl functions. The canvas allows the user to draw points
with sliders to alter the size and the rgb values of the points being drawn, along 
with a button to clear the canvas. 
This assignment was completed without a partner. 
The directory for this assignment should contain the following files that have had
significant work done: 
-driver.html             (initializes scripts and html text values) 
-eventFunctions.js       (handles all possible user interaction events)
-glslFunctions.js        (handles functions forvalues being passed to and from the shaders)
-htmlFunctions.js        (contains sendTextToHTML function for text box mouse coord use) 
-shaders.js              (initializes the vertex and colour shaders for use of program)
